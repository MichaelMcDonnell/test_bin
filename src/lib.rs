//! A module for getting the crate binary in an integration test.
//!
//! If you are writing a command-line interface app then it is useful to write
//! an integration test that uses the binary. You most likely want to launch the
//! binary and inspect the output. This module lets you get the binary so it can
//! be tested.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! basic usage:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! let output = test_bin::get_test_bin("my_cli_app")
//!     .output()
//!     .expect("Failed to start my_binary");
//! assert_eq!(
//!     String::from_utf8_lossy(&output.stdout),
//!     "Output from my CLI app!\n"
//! );
//! ```
//!
//! Refer to the [`std::process::Command` documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html)
//! for how to pass arguments, check exit status and more.

/// Returns the crate's binary as a `Command` that can be used for integration
/// tests.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `bin_name` - The name of the binary you want to test.
///
/// # Remarks
///
/// It panics on error. This is by design so the test that uses it fails.
pub fn get_test_bin(bin_name: &str) -> std::process::Command {
    // Create full path to binary
    let mut path = get_test_bin_dir();
    path.push(bin_name);
    path.set_extension(std::env::consts::EXE_EXTENSION);

    assert!(path.exists());

    // Create command
    std::process::Command::new(path.into_os_string())
}

/// Returns the directory of the crate's binary.
///
/// # Remarks
///
/// It panics on error. This is by design so the test that uses it fails.
fn get_test_bin_dir() -> std::path::PathBuf {
    // Cargo puts the integration test binary in target/debug/deps
    let current_exe =
        std::env::current_exe().expect("Failed to get the path of the integration test binary");
    let current_dir = current_exe
        .parent()
        .expect("Failed to get the directory of the integration test binary");

    let test_bin_dir = current_dir
        .parent()
        .expect("Failed to get the binary folder");
    test_bin_dir.to_owned()
}
